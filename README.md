<h1> Bio-Matcher </h1>

This is an application that best matches two equally sized groups of males and females based on text blurbs written by each person.

<h2> Setup </h2>

After cloning the repo, create three directories: **all**, **male**, and **female** in the project root directory. There, type:
```
mkdir all male female
```

Open **match.html** in your browser and use this to create text files for each person. Move all created text files to **all**. Now run the application, and the best matches will be printed to the console.
